# Horiseon_Code_Refactor

# Description

This project involves refactoring the Horiseon digital marketing agency website code to meet to accessibility standards. 
Refactoring is the process of rewriting and restructuring code to improve the design and readability of the code base. Refactoring code to meet with accessibility guidelines should also increase search engine optimization. 

> **Importance of Web Accessibility:**
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.


# Completed Task:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
